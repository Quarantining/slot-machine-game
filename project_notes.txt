v.0.1.0: Create code that displays 3 random symbols pulled from a list of 9 symbols.
   - Use letters as placeholders for symbols. Later they will be changes to images or more descriptive text.
   - List of 9 symbols may increase or decrease in number later.
   - We'll figure out how to determine if user won or lost in a later version.

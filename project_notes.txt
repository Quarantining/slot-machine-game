THIS FILE CONTAINS PROJECT NOTES:

v.0.0.1: Create code that prompts user to press enter, then displays 3 random symbols pulled from a list of 9 symbols.
   - Use letters as placeholders for symbols. Later they will be changes to images or more descriptive text.
   - List of 9 symbols may increase or decrease in number later.
   - We'll figure out how to determine if user won or lost in a later version.
